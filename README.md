# PIXOO64 CLI Controller

![Pixoo64 with Horror Picture](https://divoom.com/cdn/shop/products/pixoo64.jpg?v=1696662369&width=800)

Welcome, nerds.
This repository is about controlling Pixoo64 remotely either from CLI or any other ways.
Command names were inspired by PowerShell, but if you have any better ideas please let me know.

## Setting up the environment

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Syntax:

```shell
<command> <value>
```

Example:

```shell
Set-Brightness 90
```

## Roadmaps

- Make it compatible with M5stack Core2
  - Get image-preview
- Web server console
- Multiple Device Capability
